# A Quantum program to illustrate the ISING model which is NP-COMPLETE for 72-Qubit Quantum Computer ![](https://travis-ci.com/CodeBreaker444/A-Quantum-program-to-illustrate-the-ISING-model-which-is-NP-COMPLETE.svg?branch=master)
## > Note: Before anything *Cirq* which is a quantum library for python (A python framework for creating, editing, and invoking Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits.) is still in alpha stage and is highly susceptible to syntax changes or even basic framework changes so, use only ther versin present in the requirements.txt.
## Requirements:
- Python3
- pycharm(Optional)

> Note: This is a small personal project so expect to solve only large issues.Feel free to change the code according to your needs.
## Installation
``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```
## Packages Used
```
import cirq
import random
import sympy
import numpy as np
import timeit
